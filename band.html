    <b>ALBUMS:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Twenty One Pilots</li>
      <p>This is the first album the band ever made. It's mostly piano based on this
        album. This is the groups beginning when Tyler first began to put his thoughts
        into words. My favorite songs on this album are March to the Sea and Isles
        of Flightless Birds.
      </p>
      <li>Regional At Best</li>
      <p>This is the band's second album. The album's songs vary with style but the
        central purpose of their music is to explain thoughts that really everybody has.
        My favorite songs on this album are Forest and Kitchen Sink.
      </p>
      <li>Vessle</li>
        <p>This is the band's third album. The album's songs are a lot more heavy on the
          piano and vocals. The ocassional shouts in the song sort of wake you up a bit
          and help you understand the thoughts that are going on in not only Tyler's head
          but really any person. My all time favorite song Migraine is on this album along
          with their classic Trees.
